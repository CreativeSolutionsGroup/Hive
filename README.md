# Hive

Hive is a system that allows users to discover and share their social media with each other.

It has Google Authentication built in.

## How it works

Every user is a `Student` (since that's the realm we mainly work in)

Every student is part of a `Group`

Groups are merely the way that you would like to group students together. This is non-nullable though.

Clicking on a student takes you to their group page, where you can then view each student's social media.

Adding social media is done through the `profile` page.
